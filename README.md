## System

This hackathon requires students to pick a system and integrate it into the BrickMMO Smart City. A system could be a real life concept or application 
integrated into the BrickMMO city (power grid, autonomous driving, Twitter, etc...). Or a foundational tool used by other systems (GPS, control panel, colour palette, etc...).
